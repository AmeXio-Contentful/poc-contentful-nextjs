# Colorful Demo - Fintech

To deploy your own dedicated demo, check out the [following guide](https://contentful.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MAR/pages/2080309537/Colorful+Coin+setup+guide)

My recommendation would be to follow that guide first, which will spin up a new space for you with the populated content model and content. Then, you can use that newly created space for your local development as well.

The legal space is not spun up when the deployment script is used, instead, we re-use our existing space since it does not really need to be edited that often.

## Local development

Create an `.env` file with the folowing structure:

```
BUNDLE_ANALYZE=false
ENVIRONMENT_NAME=local

CONFIG_CONTENTFUL_META_URL=http://localhost:3000

CONFIG_CONTENTFUL_MAIN_SPACE_ID=
CONFIG_CONTENTFUL_MAIN_SPACE_TOKEN=
CONFIG_CONTENTFUL_MAIN_SPACE_PREVIEW_TOKEN=
CONFIG_CONTENTFUL_MAIN_SPACE_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN=
CONFIG_CONTENTFUL_LEGAL_SPACE_ID=
CONFIG_CONTENTFUL_LEGAL_SPACE_TOKEN=

CONTENTFUL_DEPLOY_TOKEN=
CONTENTFUL_DEPLOY_ORG=

VERCEL_DEPLOY_TOKEN=

NEXT_PUBLIC_NINETAILED_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_NINETAILED_ENVIRONMENT=
```

You can find the values for the legal space environment variables by checking out the `.env` file linked here [Installation guide](https://contentful.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MAR/pages/2080309537/Colorful+Coin+setup+guide#Installing)

Note that that .env file contains some additional variables that are only needed if you will be using the deployment script to spin up your own instance of the demo.

---

Once you have the `.env` file in place, and you have installed dependencies with `yarn`, you can run

```
yarn dev
```

to start the local development server. By default, the server will listen on `http://localhost:3000`

## Content model changes

Whenever you make changes to the content model, you will want to fetch new introspection files, as well as generate TypeScript types.

To start, you will need to install the apollo npm package globally:

```
npm i apollo -g
```

You can then run the following npm scripts:

```
npm run gen:introspections && npm run gen:query-types
```

That will generate the introspection files used by the Apollo GraphQL client, as well as typescript types that will be generated in the `__generated__` directory right next to the files where you use `gql` tag to specify a GraphQL query. You can then reference those ts files in your components.

## Contentful Components

The term _Contentful Components_ (_ctf-compoents_ for short) is used for react components which have an equivalent contentful _content type_. E.g. all react components needed for rendering the _content-type_ **HeroBanner** can be found in the folder **src/ctf-components/ctf-hero-banner**.

Usually a _ctf-component_ is composed of 3 files:

- **ctf-[contentypeName]-query.ts** (holding the query strings needed for the graphql request to fetch the components data)
- **ctf-[contentypeName]-gql.tsx** (react component which executes the graphql query and passes the result to a component for rendering)
- **ctf-[contentypeName].tsx** (the react component which is actually rendering the content type)

and (optionally) a folder with typescript interfaces which were generated by apollo:

- **\_\_generated\_\_** (see [Content model changes](#content-model-changes))

The reason for splitting a _ctf-component_ into **ctf-[contentypeName]-gql** and **ctf-[contentypeName]-gql** is so that a _content type_ can be rendered either by only knowing its `id` and its `__typename` (which are passed to the **-gql** react component) or by passing all the necessary content (e.g. when all of its data was fetched in a previous request) to the component without a suffix.

### Component Resolver and content type mapping

There is a _component-resolver_ (_./src/components/component-resolver.tsx_) react component, which is used to pick the right react component for rendering a _content-type_. It requires as properties the _content type_ `id`, its `__typename`, `internalName` (used by xray mode), and optionally the content. The **component-resolver** then uses a key map to find the right react component (**./src/mappings.ts**), where the key is the _content type_ name and the value is the react component.

It will check the map `componentMap` first, and if the _content type_ could be resolved it is assumed all content is available (see also [Referenced content types in pages](#referenced-content-types-in-pages)). The content is then passed to the react component.

If the _content type_ could not be resolved, `componentGqlMap` will be used for resolving. If the react component is found the _content type_ `id`, `__typename`, and `internalName` will be passed, which is used by the component to fetch its data.

According to this pattern, all _ctf-components_ suffixed with **-gql** should be added to `componentGqlMap` and all without a suffix should be added to `componentMap`.

### Referenced content types in pages

The Page content type which describes a page of the website has the fields `topSection`, `content` and `extraSection`. These are normally fields which are referencing other _content types_ which have a corresponding react component in the frontend for rendering. There are two ways how the frontend is requesting the content of these referenced _content types_ when it is rendering a page:

- requesting only the _content types_ `__typename`, `id` and its `internalName`
- or additionally requesting all needed content in the intial page request.

When all of the needed content should be requested with the initial page request, you have to create a graphql fragment with the definition of the content and add it to the `ComponentReferenceFragment` in **./src/ctf-components/fragments.ts**.

**Caution**: Adding fragments to `ComponentReferenceFragment` will increase the page request payload. Currently Contentfuls limit for GraphQL requests is 8Kb, and there is a limit of the query complexity as well. For this reason, none of the components are currently added to the `fragments.ts` file, but you are free to experiment with it.

### Creating new Contentful Components

Creating new _ctf-components_ involves following steps:

- If the contentful content model changed you should update introspection data first by calling `npm run gen:introspections`.
- Create a folder for the compnent files (_./src/ctf-components/ctf-[contentTypeName]_)
- Create the file for the graphql query strings (_./src/ctf-components/ctf-[contentTypeName]-query.ts_)
- optionally, generate typescript interfaces for the graphql result by calling `npm run gen:query-types:cful` (see [Content model changes](#content-model-changes)).
- create react components for rendering (**./src/ctf-components/ctf-[contentTypeName]-gql.tsx** and **./src/ctf-components/ctf-[contentTypeName].tsx**).
- Add the component to the `componentGqlMap` in _./src//mappings.ts_.
- Optionally, add the component to `componentMap`. In that case you can add the graphql Fragment, which describes its content, to the `ComponentReferenceFragment` in _./src/ctf-components/fragments.ts_ (beware though because there is a limit to how many components can be added, see [Referenced content types in pages](#referenced-content-types-in-pages)).

# Storybook

Colorful Coin now has a matching Storybook. You can see a hosted version [here](https://storybook.coin.colorfuldemo.com/).

Stories are defined in the `/src/stories` folder. You can follow an example there to add new components to your Storybook. General steps would be:

- Create a new folder for your story
- Create a .tsx file (or .jsx if you are not familiar with TypeScript)
- Import the component that you are tryign to document from `/src/ctf-components`
- Wrap it into the `Wrapper` component
- Pass the correct props that the component expects

## Importing / exporting space contents

Importing space contents (Models, Entries, Environments, App Integrations etc) is done as part of the `init` script. When developing, we often want to make changes to what will become our internal CF test space, for example removing an entry or renaming an environment. To make sure that the `content-backups` file stays up to date, after making changes in our contentful internal test space, we should _re-export_ the updated space contents.

This can be done using the Contentful CLI tool, by running the following command:

`contentful space export --space-id {{spaceId}}`

Where spaceId is the space id of the test contentful space. see here https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/tutorials/cli/import-and-export for installation and authentication information.

See the above section, `Content model changes`, for information about generating new GraphQl introspection files when making changes to the content model.
